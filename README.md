# SwipeMart for Walmart

This android app aims at being an effective Survey tool for companies like Walmart. Currently based on just the Walmart API (https://developer.walmartlabs.com/), it starts with the User providing a search query which then takes him to a like/dislike screen. He then proceeds to like thos products which seems to be what he was looking for and 'dislikes' the rest.
At the end, a histogram is presented which shows which price ranges the user was interested in along with a list of items he liked and other statistical measures.
